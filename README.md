Build a Reacts app modeled after the image above.  Included in this repo is an [html file](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Web-Props-Lab/blob/master/index.html) that renders a static version in HTML.  Your React app should have the following components:

## Top Bar

Displays the welcome banner for the donation page

## Recent Donations

Displays a list of each of the previous donations, including the amounts, names and captions

## Progress

- Displays how much total money has been raised out of the goal
- (Bonus) Display a progress bar that is filled up to the appropriate percentage

## Donation Form

Should include:

- A field for the donor's name to be entered
- A field for the caption
- A [range](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type_range.asp) that sets the donation amount
- A "Donate" button
